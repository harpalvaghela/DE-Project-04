# Project 4: Fabric Data Pipeline
## Task 1: Incremental Data Loading, SCDType1 and Notifications
## Task 2: Sales Data Modeling and Reporting Pipeline using Microsoft Fabric


üìå Overview

In today‚Äôs data-driven world, businesses must efficiently ingest and transform large volumes of structured data while ensuring reliability and transparency in the pipeline. This project solves the challenge of loading on-premises data incrementally into Microsoft Fabric, transforming it for analytics, and sending automated notifications upon successful refresh.

### üß© Project Steps

## Task 1: Incremental Data Loading, SCDType1 and Notifications

###### Steps: On-Premises Data Ingestion
- Connect to source using On-Prem Gateway.
- Load into Fabric Lakehouse.
- Perform SCD Type 1 using Fabric Notebooks.
- Load to separate lakehouse tables and notify via email on success.

## Task 2: Sales Data Modeling and Reporting Pipeline using Microsoft Fabric

###### Step 1: Sales Data from ADLS Gen2
- Transform Excel sales file (deduplication, type casting, null filtering).
- Load into Lakehouse as dimension tables.

###### Step 2: Sales Return Data

- Clean and transform return Excel file.
- Create a junk dimension for return flag (Yes/No).
- Store as a dimension table in Lakehouse.

###### Step 3: Fact Table and Reporting

- Join all dimension tables to create a normalized fact_sales table.
- Display enriched records via SQL view.
- Connect Power BI to the view for interactive dashboards.
